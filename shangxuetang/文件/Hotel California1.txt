On a dark desert highway, cool wind in my hair #0
Warm smell of colitas, rising up through the air #1
Up ahead in the distance, I saw a shimmering light #2
My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim #3
I had to stop for the night #4
There she stood in the doorway; #5
I heard the mission bell #6
And I was thinking to myself, "This could be Heaven or this could be Hell" #7
Then she lit up a candle and she showed me the way #8
There were voices down the corridor, #9
I thought I heard them say... #10
"Welcome to the Hotel California Such a lovely place, Such a lovely face Plenty of rooms at the Hotel California Any time of year, you can find it here" #11
Her mind is Tiffany-twisted, she got the Mercedes benz #12
She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys, that she calls friends #13
How they dance in the courtyard, sweet summer sweat. #14
Some dance to remember, some dance to forget #15
So I called up the Captain, "Please bring me my winlizhaoxiang.come" #16
He said, 'We haven't had that spirit here since 1969' #17
And still those voices are calling from far away, #18
Wake you up in the middle of the night #19
Just to hear them say... #20
Welcome to the Hotel California Such a lovely place, Such a lovely face They living it up at the Hotel California What a nice surprise, bring your alibis #21
Mirrors on the ceiling, The pink champagne on ice #22
And she said 'We are all just prisoners here, of our own device' #23
And in the master's chambers, They gathered for the feast #24
They stab it with their steely knives, #25
But they just can't kill the beast #26
Last thing I remember, I was  #27
running for the door #28
I had to find the passage back to the place I was before #29
